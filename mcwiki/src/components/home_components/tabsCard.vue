                NeoForge (current version and later), Fabric (version 1.14 and later), Liteloader (version 1.12.2 or lower), Rift (version 1.13.X only) or Quilt
                (version 1.14 and later), etc. as frontends. In addition to this, <a>Packets</a>, the original module mechanism, is available in version 1.13 and later. </p><br>
              <p>Most of the Bedrock Edition mods are called Add-on (<a>Additional Packs</a>), which contain <a>Resource Packs</a>, <a>Behavior Packs</a>, and <a>Skin Packs</a>, among others. </p><br>
              <p>In the server, those that have similar functionality to mods are called add-ons. </p><br>
              <p>Mods can be found at sites like <a>CurseForge</a> and <a>Modrinth</a>. </p><br>
