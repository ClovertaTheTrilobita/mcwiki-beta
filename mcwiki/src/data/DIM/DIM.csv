Overworld,"The Overworld is the dimension where Minecraft players begin their journey, the player's default birthplace, and an environment similar to the real Earth, with dense forests, vast plains, endless seas, and towering mountains. Here, players have access to abundant resources, a rich life and exciting adventures.",GameSettings,Images/DIM/Overworld.png
The Nether,"The Nether, a closed, dangerous dimension filled with fire, lava, fungal vegetation, and many hostile creatures, is a world that exists in a different dimension from the main world, and a cave dimension.",GameSettings,Images/DIM/The_Nether.png
The End,"The End, also known as the Land of the End, is an abrupt, empty plain. The world archive for The End is in the DIM1 folder; deleting it causes The End to reset. This dimension consists of the main island (containing Mordorite, Obsidian Pillars (with Mordor Crystals and Iron Fences (some Mordor Crystals)), and a Return Portal made of bedrock) and the outer island (1.9+). This dimension has a large number of Endbringers (generated more frequently than the main world) as well as an Endbringer Dragon. At the same time, this dimension does not naturally generate creatures from the main world and the lower world.",GameSettings,Images/DIM/The_End.png
